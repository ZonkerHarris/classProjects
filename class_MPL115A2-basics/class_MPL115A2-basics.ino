 * 
 * At 1.5 hPa resolution, the MPL115A2 is not as precise as the BMP085, which has up to 
 * 0.03 hPa resolution so we don't suggest the MPL115A2 as a precision altimeter.
 * 
 * i2c address is 0x60, and cannot be changed.  Price was $8(US) as of this writing.
 * 
 * Pinouts:  Vin takes 3-5v   3o is the *output* of the 3.3v regulator on the board!
 *    GND goes to ground.  SDA is the i2c Data bus lead, SCL is the i2c Clock lead. 
 *    
 * Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter cannot run at the same time. Pick only one!
 * 
 * This is from the Adafruit example sketch. It doesn't read the sensor into a variable,
 *  but rather it simply prints the variable. Notice it calls the funtion, and tells
 *  which variable will receive the first and second results!
mpl115a2.getPT(&pressureKPA,&temperatureC);
Serial.print("Pressure (kPa): "); Serial.print(pressureKPA, 4); Serial.print(" kPa  ");
Serial.print("Temp (*C): "); Serial.print(temperatureC, 1); Serial.println(" *C both measured together");
 * 
 * Since I wanted to also show the Fahrenheit value, I need to get the C value and calculate.

  // Read our sensor values
  /*  When you call a function you can also send it info when you call...
   *   that is why you have the parenthesis. In these cases, we are not
   *   sending any data. 
   *  Every function will return some value. If nothing else, it will return
   *   a "true" if it ran without an error. In these cases, calling each 
   *   variable will return a floating point number representing the desired
   *   environmental reading.
   *   
   * Barometric Pressure is read out in KPA (KiloPascals)
   *  The pascal (symbol Pa) is the SI unit of pressure. It is equivalent to 
   *  one newton per square metre. The unit is named after Blaise Pascal, the 
   *  eminent French mathematician, physicist and philosopher.
   * 
   * You can find a conversion chart here, to other pressure scales...

   * 
   * In the US, we're often used to weather reports in "Inches of Mercury"...
   *  Inches of mercury or inHg is a non-SI unit for pressure. It is still widely 
   *  used for barometric pressure in weather reports and aviation in the U.S., 
   *  but is considered somewhat outdated elsewhere.
   * It is defined as the pressure exerted by a column of mercury of 1 inch in 
   *  height at 32 °F (0 °C) at the standard acceleration of gravity.
   *
   *    1 inHg = 3,386.389 pascals at 0 °C.
   *    1 pascal is equal to 0.001 kpa, or 0.00029529983071445 inhg.
   *    
   * Aircraft operating at higher altitudes (above 18,000 feet) set their 
   * barometric altimeters to a standard pressure of 29.92 inHg or 1,013.2 hPa 
   * (1 hPa = 1 mbar) regardless of the actual sea level pressure, with 
   * inches of mercury used in the U.S. and Canada. The resulting altimeter 
   * readings are known as flight levels.

  //  (How many seconds in 5 minutes? How many in 30 minutes? How many in an hour?)
  // Remember that the delay function is in MILLISECONDS (1,000ths of a second).
